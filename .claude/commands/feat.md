You will be implementing a new feature in this codebase:

$ARGUMENTS

IMPORTANT:
- Before you start, if there are any gaps or assumptions, verify with me and ask questions before proceeding with the implementation.
- All code must follow clean code principles and industry-standard React best practices, with an emphasis on:
    - Keeping files and functions small, modular, and well-named to reduce future token usage.
    - Prioritizing readability, maintainability, and testability.
    - Using functional components, hooks, and TypeScript where appropriate.
- After implementation, update the @docs/manual.md file to reflect the new feature and its expected behavior.
- After implementation ask me if I want to add unitests and what functionality to cover
