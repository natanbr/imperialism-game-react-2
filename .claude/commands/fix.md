You will be fixing a bug in this codebase:

$ARGUMENTS:

IMPORTANT:
- Before you start, if there are any gaps or assumptions, verify with me and ask questions before proceeding with the implementation.
- All code must follow clean code principles and industry-standard React best practices, with an emphasis on:
    - Keeping files and functions small, modular, and well-named to reduce future token usage.
    - Prioritizing readability, maintainability, and testability.
    - Using functional components, hooks, and TypeScript where appropriate.
- While fixing the bug and viewing related files, if you recognize any violations from the list above, update the @docs/REFACTORING_PLAN.md with your suggestions. For each item:
    - Write a short description using blue color in the terminal output for easy visibility.
    - Include a priority for each suggestion.
    - Only analyze relevant files; do not read unrelated files for this task.
    - In REFACTORING_PLAN.md, clearly mention that these suggestions were identified in the context of this bug fix and have to be properly explored before applying.
- After implementation, ask me if I want to add unit tests and clarify which functionality to cover.
