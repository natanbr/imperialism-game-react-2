## Resuming here

- 2026-11-02: plan approved (continue, v1 = M0 to M4). Light flow in `docs/FLOW.md`. Rules in
  `docs/rules/` (gaps in `gaps.md`). Progress page: https://claude.ai/artifact/JHRFaWQRPk3AYGssSchPBU.
- M0 to M4 are merged into `main` (PR 9, 10, 12 to 15, 17); their entries are archived in
  `docs/journal/archive-M1.md` to `-M4.md`. Decisions Q5 to Q16 settled (NR-012 to NR-018).
- M4.1 (PR 18), M4.2 (PR 19) and M4.3 (PR 20, main 274ef62) are merged; entries archived in
  `docs/journal/archive-M4.1.md` to `-M4.3.md`. Q17, Q19 and Q20 answered as NR-029, NR-028, NR-027.
- 2026-11-12 M4.4 (NR-027, NR-028; FR-140 to FR-142) merged (PR 21, main e018d85; entry archived in
  `docs/journal/archive-M4.4.md`). Recruiting not built (probe in `scripts/probes/m4-4/`); decision card
  Q21 open, option (a) "no recruiting" taken meanwhile. v1 (M0 to M4.4) is complete.
- 2026-11-12 night shift (NR-030): v2 planning and implementation. Plan on branch `claude/v2-plan`
  (this worktree, the old docs worktree `imperialism-game-revival-fee36d`); one branch per milestone
  after it. The progress page files now live on these branches too (copied from the docs branch).
- 2026-11-13 M5 (FR-144 to FR-160, FR-235) merged (PR 23, main 0bfd870; entries archived in
  `docs/journal/archive-M5.md`). The app plays the continent. Card Q22 (the continent's tilt) still open.
- 2026-11-13 M6 Diplomacy (FR-161 to FR-181, FR-236 to FR-241) merged (PR 24, main 2a60a3b; entries archived in
  `docs/journal/archive-M6.md`). Decision card "who receives a grant" (M6 fix round decision 3) still to add.
- 2026-11-13 M7 Nation-to-nation trade (FR-183 to FR-198, FR-242 to FR-259) merged (PR 25, main d16afa7; entries archived in
  `docs/journal/archive-M7.md`). Card Q47 (the World market's greyed "−") still open.
- 2026-11-13 M8 Armies (FR-199 to FR-215, FR-260 to FR-271) merged (PR 26, main c91f2fd; entries archived in
  `docs/journal/archive-M8.md`). Nathan's art pack (NR-031) committed on top (4bd00eb).
- 2026-11-13 M9 War and the attack screen (FR-216 to FR-234, FR-272 to FR-281) merged (PR 27, main f817da2; entries archived
  in `docs/journal/archive-M9.md`).
- 2026-11-13 M10 Council of Governors (FR-290 to FR-305) in progress on `claude/m10-council` (worktree
  `imperialism-game-revival-fee36d`): engine half first, then the UI half on its API. Not pushed.

Carried forward:
- Deferred: river ports and the depot-on-port rule (rules 04); University fees; the power plant.
- UI: the cursors are still emoji. Not built from M3: Q15 (c) "repeat last turn's trades".
- The NR-016 list of other same-turn effects (archive-M4, part A entry) waits for a decision.
- M5 design item (M4 review note 5): partly settled by FR-115 (with a civilian selected elsewhere, a
  click on a tile's civilians is the selected civilian's order there); with none selected, a click on
  a tile's centre still selects its civilian, not the tile.
- M4.1 review note 5: the rail path search (`railPath` in `engine/ai/railPlan.ts`) treats a tile with
  a temporary job (prospecting, development) as blocked, so the engineer takes a longer route, or finds
  none, rather than waiting the few turns until the job ends.
- M4.1 review note 7 (decision 4): Expand, freight cars, training and sales can still cut a standing
  order without a refusal (as on main, now visible in the dialog), and an older dead order whose inputs
  come back takes its labour back the next turn, cutting a newer order. Not changed in M4.1.
- M4.3 review finding 4: `isDepotSite` checks only hills; it does not call `railTerrainAllowed`. Today a
  depot needs no rail on its own tile, so it does not matter; when technologies become lockable, a
  depot site SHALL also require `railTerrainAllowed` (the section into it is built on it).
- M4.3 review finding 5: `railPath` (`engine/ai/railPlan.ts`) finds the path with the fewest tiles, not
  the fewest missing sections, so it can ignore rail already built that a slightly longer path would reuse.
- M4.3 review finding 6 (hypothesis, not run): the score drop since M4.3 may come partly from
  `bestDepotSite`'s gain counting every gathered unit equally; weighing each unit by what the economy
  actually uses (food eaten, inputs of running buildings, what sells) may pick better sites.
- M4.4 review note 7: a stale store entry (an allocation in `transportAllocationsByNation` for a commodity
  that now has nothing to ship) flashes its group once per open, until the next slider move writes the
  clamped allocations back. The popup's local state clamps it right after the first render; the store keeps it.
- M4.4 review note 10: in the lever table the "free worker" rows add a worker who eats raw food, so what they
  lose is a freight car's load of inputs every turn, not the cost of recruiting. Only the guarded rows (a
  free worker after a labour-bound turn, R1, R2) support the conclusion that recruiting does not pay; the
  rows with a free worker every turn (sick and starved workers) say little about a policy.

## 2026-11-02 Revival setup

Size: L (process). Decisions: continue not restart; gold $200 / gems $500; delete superseded
branches and untrack old tool configs; v3 AI scripted and LLM behind one interface. Light
flow adopted from the work-repo SDD flow; reviews batched per milestone to cut cost.

## 2026-11-03 M1 headless core (archived)

Entries in `docs/journal/archive-M1.md`. Engine in `src/app/engine/` (Order, validate, apply,
resolveTurn, systems `(state, ctx)`, seeded RNG, scripted player); the store holds one
`GameState` plus UI state and the UI only submits orders. FR-001 to FR-026 tested; 280 unit
tests, Playwright 7 passed. Two objections went to M2: the job completion flags and the
`newGame` import of a test fixture (both settled in M2 part A).

## 2026-11-03 M2 economic loop (archived)

Entries in `docs/journal/archive-M2.md`. Production buildings with capacity and standing orders,
recipes, labour, food and sickness, training, migration, freight cars from lumber + steel + labour,
the Spring 1815 calendar, real job durations and costs; the engine owns the start world; capital
dialog, HUD date and food warning. FR-027 to FR-059 tested; 472 unit tests, Playwright 8 passed,
1 skipped. Merged as PR 13. Open: decision Q9 (freight cars count this turn; the rules say next turn).

## 2026-11-03 M3 money and score (archived)

Entries in `docs/journal/archive-M3.md`, with the decision cards Q10 to Q15. One world market
(sell, buy, cargo holds, price drift), the score (treasury + industry + development), game over after
40 turns, the market dialog, HUD score and game-over screen. FR-060 to FR-078 tested; 588 unit tests,
Playwright 10 passed, 1 skipped. Merged as PR 14 (review: merge, nothing must-fix; carried-forward list
in the archive's review entry).

## 2026-11-04 M3.5 small map and clean look (archived)

Entries in `docs/journal/archive-M3.5.md`. The rail line fix (FR-079), the 24x16 two-island start
world with island 2 kept for M4 (FR-080 to FR-083), Game Icons, faint terrain tints, the minimalist
palette and 42 px tiles (FR-084 to FR-090), and the review fix round (FR-091 to FR-096); 654 unit
tests, Playwright 15 passed, 1 skipped. Merged as PR 15; the carried-forward list is in "Resuming
here" and the archive's last entry.

## 2026-11-09 M4 second nation (archived)

Entries in `docs/journal/archive-M4.md`. Nation 2 "Valdoria" on island 2, played by the scripted player
at End Turn (FR-097 to FR-105); the score table, news per nation, Valdoria read-only, New game, 24 px
worker buttons and the tray (FR-106 to FR-111); review fix round. Merged as PR 17. Carried forward: the
list in "Resuming here".

## 2026-11-10 M4.1 play-test fixes (archived)

Entries in `docs/journal/archive-M4.1.md`, with its review fix round. Civilians share tiles, one job per
tile (FR-112 to FR-115); one production plan for the phase, the labour and the capital dialog (FR-116 to
FR-120); commodity icons in the market and capital (FR-121); a scripted engineer that builds depots and
joins them by the shortest rail path (FR-122 to FR-124). Merged as PR 18 (main b4d26ee).

## 2026-11-10 M4.2 scripted player score (archived)

Entries in `docs/journal/archive-M4.2.md`, with its review fix round. `engine/ai/economy.ts`: every
lumber + steel pair becomes capacity, goods fill the holds, pairs bought under $1,000, cheapest
development level first, depots only when they pay back (FR-125 to FR-132). Against the frozen M4 player,
seeds 1 to 4: turn 15 1.60 to 1.65 times, turn 25 1.76 to 1.81, turn 40 2.39 to 2.55. Merged as PR 19 (main a267a03).
## 2026-11-12 M4.3 transport popup and rail links (archived)

Entries in `docs/journal/archive-M4.3.md`, with its review fix round. The transport popup with icons, groups by
kind and columns (FR-133 to FR-135); rail links are only the sections built, the triangle bug (FR-136 to
FR-139); the scripted engineer orders sections. Lowest FR-125 ratio 1.60 to 1.55. Merged as PR 20 (main
274ef62).

## 2026-11-12 M4.4 Recruiting AI and empty groups (archived)

Entry in `docs/journal/archive-M4.4.md`, with its probe tables and review fix round. The transport popup lists only
what the network can carry and hides empty groups (FR-141, FR-142); the furniture bound counts 2 lumber (FR-140);
recruiting measured and not built (probe in `scripts/probes/m4-4/`, card Q21 option a). Merged as PR 21 (main e018d85).

## 2026-11-13 v2 plan (night shift, NR-030)

Size: L (plan). Branch `claude/v2-plan`. Ultracode workflow 1 (8 agents): code map (Sonnet 5.5 xhigh), four web
research lanes (Sonnet 5.5 xhigh: trade, diplomacy, army, combat; the combat lane stalled on a browser call and
was re-run with web pages only), rules writer (Sonnet 5.5 xhigh), spot-check (Sonnet 5.5 high), spec writer
(Opus 5.5 high: a spec others execute).

- Plan: `docs/REVIVAL_PLAN.md` section 5b (M5 to M10, seven architecture decisions).
- Rules: `docs/rules/01`, `06`, `07`, `08` extended, new `11-screens.md`; gaps updated (F12 to F19, H1 to H18).
  Main source: a Let's Play of Imperialism (1997) with screenshots (lparchive.org); every number tagged Imp1,
  Imp1 [?] or remake. Spot-check: 13 of 18 claims confirmed on the screenshots, 5 tagged [?]; the orchestrator
  opened Update 07 itself (text confirms the worker grades; costs are only on the screenshots).
- Requirements: FR-144 to FR-234 (M5 FR-144 to 160, M6 161 to 181, M7 182 to 198, M8 199 to 215, M9 216 to 234).
- Decision cards (defaults taken, nobody to ask; on the progress page): Q22 one land-bridge minor (Arvelia)
  and three island minors (option b, the spec writer's suggestion: neither capital province borders a minor);
  Q23 one province per minor; Q24 ten relation points a level, +1 a trade, +10 a pact, -40 a war; Q25 equal
  start relations; Q26 a consulate is needed to trade with a minor (plan rule; Imp1 needs none); Q27 a minor
  offers 1 unit per resource tile (at most 6) and buys 2 of each good; Q28 favourite partner = points +
  subsidy / 2, deals at the board price; Q29 the computer accepts alliance at level 7 and peace when losing;
  Q30 start army 2 Regulars, 1 Artillery, militia, fort on the capital; Q31 derived regiment costs, no
  Sappers; Q32 simple combat numbers (8 rounds, 70% hit); Q33 one army per country per province; Q34 a taken
  Great Power capital ends that nation, a taken minor capital makes a colony; Q35 the computer may attack the
  weakest minor from turn 10, never a Great Power; Q36 upkeep it cannot pay disbands the newest regiments;
  Q37 Join the Empire, rail and sea moves, generals and medals stay out of v2.
- Objection: one province per minor and one army per province make war short (one battle takes a minor);
  acceptable for a first playable war, revisit after Nathan plays.

Entries in `docs/journal/archive-M5.md`: engine half, UI half, review fix round (19 findings), QA fix round (FR-235).
